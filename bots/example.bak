########### ROOMS ###########
# Nomi supports a group chat style concept called "Rooms". When using the Rooms mode, your Nomi will not only
# respond when pinged or when one of their keywords is triggered, but they'll be aware of all messages sent
# in the Discord channel you specify by ID in the Name field. They may also respond randomly, depending on
# the value you provide for RandomResponseChance.
# ***** This only works for Nomis, not Kindroids. *****
# Kindroid has a different system. For Kindroids in ROOMS mode, Kins are sent the last handful of messages
# sent in the channel when they are due to respond. You can configure how many messages are sent for context
# using the KIN_ROOM_CONTEXT_MESSAGES variable above. Kins in ROOMS mode have NO long term memory. They pull
# from their backstory and key memories, and use the context of the last handful of messages to respond.
#
# See https://github.com/d3tourrr/NomiKin-Discord/blob/main/README.md for more information.

# Set chat style to "ROOMS" if you want to use Rooms. Otherwise leave blank, or any other value
CHAT_STYLE=NORMAL

# Provide a list of Discord channels
# This part of the config follows a VERY specific format. Be careful.
# The name of the room must be the Discord channel ID (you need to enable Discord developer tools to see channel IDs)
# Below is an example of how the format should look. Nomis and Kins follow different formats.

# FOR NOMIS - LEAVE BLANK IF YOUR COMPANION IS A KINDROID
