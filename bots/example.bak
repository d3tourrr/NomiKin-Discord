########### NOMI ROOMS ###########
# Nomi supports a group chat style concept called "Rooms". When using the Rooms mode, your Nomi will not only
# respond when pinged or when one of their keywords is triggered, but they'll be aware of all messages sent
# in the Discord channel you specify by ID in the Name field. They may also respond randomly, depending on
# the value you provide for RandomResponseChance.
# See https://github.com/d3tourrr/NomiKin-Discord/blob/main/README.md for more information.
# ***** This only works for Nomis, not Kindroids. *****

# Set chat style to "ROOMS" if you want to use Rooms. Otherwise leave blank, or any other value
CHAT_STYLE=NORMAL

# Provide a list of Discord channels
# This part of the config follows a VERY specific format. Be careful.
# The name of the room must be the Discord channel ID (you need to enable Discord developer tools to see channel IDs)
# Below is an example of how the format should look.
# NOMI_ROOMS='[{"Name": "1281953849208471603", "Note": "General chat", "Backchanneling": true, "RandomResponseChance": 10}, {"Name": "1282009168307421214", "Note": "For respectful conversations about pie", "Backchanneling": true, "RandomResponseChance": 0}]'
